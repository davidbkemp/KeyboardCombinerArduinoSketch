KeyboardCombinerArduinoSketch
=============================

Arduino sketch: USB Keyboard combiner.
It combines the inputs from up to three keyboards, primarily to work around
the way Mac computers do not allow the modifier keys of one keyboard to act
on the keys of another keyboard.
In particular, it allows you to use foot pedals as Shift/Alt/Command/Control modifiers
for a keyboard.
